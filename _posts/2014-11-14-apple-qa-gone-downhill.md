title: Apple's QA has really gone down hill
---

In the past both Apple's hardware and software have impressed me. Not only did they have a fancy chrome, they also provided robust stability that I can always count on. FWIW, I used to do homework on top of my MBP 2010 for more than a year and it hasn't been damaged in any way.

Not any more.

Their QA has been really bad for me since the 10.9 release. I still recall that I was greeted by the inability to surf the Net after performing an upgrade from 10.7 to 10.9.

And things get worse with the 10.10 release.

I can easily name some glitches I encountered without really thinking

* Mobile Safari random lock-ups (see the image above).
* OS X Safari's address bar would randomly get stuck in a "over-transparent" state when you can only restart Safari to get it back to work.
* Safari's well-known DNS hiccups where name resolution would sometime stuck

Oh, did I mention that their CDN still suck? Updating apps takes ages and I really wished the Apple execs could experience the speed themselves by visiting Hong Kong.

The ONLY thing that is holding me back is, frankly, the keyboard. The level of comfort of typing on a MBP is simply unparalleled. It is so amazing that I am willing to compromise.
