I kinda wished that HKTV is a modern, forward-thinking company.

They wasn't.

First they were delivering live streams through HTTP. Oh, did I mention that the IP is hard-coded in the website (and possibly their mobile applications)? Delivering video streams over HTTP is indeed something acceptable but it would be cool to offload most of the traffic to its users. Money is good, right?

Second they were having a really dated stack. Squid as reverse proxy. Apache 2.2.15. I would expect that to be something from TVB, not HKTV. Man it is Ricky Wong, the guy who first laid territory-wide fiber optics. Okay, "if it ain't broke don't fix it", but how could things be *broken* before they were even live?

Third they have some really bad graphics. Like... they haven't improved after becoming a TV station. I thought that I tuned into the old, "HKBN BBTV" instead of a hyped television station.
